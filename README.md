### An Introduction to the Python Programming Language

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language originally designed by Guido van Rossum.  This introduction assumes that you have some experience in another high-level programming language, such as C++ or Java.  We will examine essential Python syntax, coding conventions and explore some of the built-in functions in the Python standard library.

### Essential Syntax

#### Comments

Single line comments in Python begin with the hash `#` symbol.  Multi-line comments are supported using three double quotes as delimiters.

    #  A single line comment

    """ A multiline comment can be
        written by using three quotes
        in sequence, and then by ending
        with the same
    """
